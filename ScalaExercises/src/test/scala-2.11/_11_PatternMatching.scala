class _11_PatternMatching extends FunSuite with Matchers {

  /* Scala has a built-in general pattern matching mechanism. It allows to match on any sort of data with a first-match policy.
  Here is a small example which shows how to match against an integer value:

      object MatchTest1 extends App {
        def matchTest(x: Int): String = x match {
          case 1 => "one"
          case 2 => "two"
          case _ => "many"
        }
        println(matchTest(3))
      }

  The block with the 'case' statements defines a function which maps integers to strings.
  The 'match' keyword provides a convenient way of applying a function (like the pattern matching function above) to an object.

  Scalaâ€™s pattern matching statement is most useful for matching on algebraic types expressed via 'case classes'.
  Scala also allows the definition of patterns independently of case classes, using 'unapply' methods in extractor objects.
